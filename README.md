# PagerankAlgorithm
 Final project for Linear Algebra focusing on the mathematical implementation of the Google's famous Pagerank algorithm.

## Abstract
On average, sixty million Americans utilize search engines every day. Google alone processes forty-six percent of all search requests, nearly double the traffic of Yahoo and four times that of MSN. Historically, web surfers tend to stick to one or two search engines if the results continue to be reliable. Thus, as long as Google continues to provide relevant and exceptional results there is no reason to assume that it will not remain king of all search engines. Googleâ€™s results continue to be exceptional due to the employment of the PageRank Algorithm developed by the co-founder of Google Incorporated, Larry Page.
